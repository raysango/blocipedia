<h1>Blocipedia: SaaS Wiki Collaboration Tool</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Build an application that allows users to create public and private Markdown-based wikis. We'll call our application "Blocipedia", but you're free to name it anything you want.</p>

<h2>Use case</h2>

<p>Wikis are a great way to collaborate on community-sourced content. Whether the wiki is for a hobby or work-related project, we'll build an app that lets users create their own wikis and share them publicly or privately with other collaborators.</p>
